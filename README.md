# Getting started with Data Science

This is a repository for the Intro to Data Science workshop at Tech Rebalanced 2018. 

If you would like to code along, please make sure you have **Anaconda with Python 3.7** installed. You can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and follow instructions for setup on a Mac [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/) and on Windows [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).

Anaconda comes with Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and several other packages for data science, including statsmodels and scikit-learn.

If you're a beginner to Python and have never used it before, I recommend checking out [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) and [Hear Me Code](https://hearmecode.com/) (where I first learnt Python!). Once you're comfortable with the basics, I recommend picking a small project or dataset to get started with. [Chris Albon's blog](https://chrisalbon.com/) is a great site to keep open as you dive into a dataset. 

My favourite statistics resource is [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf). I also recommend [Storytelling with Data](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/) as you're thinking about how best to communicate your findings.

If you have any questions or notice any errors in my code, please let me know! You can find me on Twitter @mostlyinane or shoot me an email at ritika.s.bhasker (at) gmail. You can also see some of my existing and ongoing projects at www.datawrites.co
